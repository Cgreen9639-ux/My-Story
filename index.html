            <h4>Introduction</h4>  
            <p>My name is Cameron Earl Greene and I was a small kid from Elkridge, MD around rural nice Middle Class Folk. I had the capability to learn a lot and to learn from my father in business as well as military, political, & scientific history. Years later, I made the best decision of my life which was to go to the honors college of UMBC where I learned how to design, code on the front end, and full stack APIs.</p>

            <p>I was a sheltered 21-year-old college student that had to adapt my academic smarts into "street smarts." I faced many dangerous situations but trusted in the Lord to guide me through.</p>
